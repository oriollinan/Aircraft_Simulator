# Aircraft_Simulator

This project is completely done using C Modular and CSFML.

This project, is a 2D visualization panel showing a simulatation of air traffic (AT).

The air traffic is a complex system with very strict rules to manage a large number of aircrafts.

The basic rules for the my_radar are as follows:
    • aircrafts fly from given places to other ones.
    • aircrafts appear on the simulation panel when they take off.
    • aircrafts disappear from the simulation panel when they land on.
    • aircrafts move in a straight line at given constant speeds.
    • aircrafts colliding with another one is destroyed and disappear from the simulation panel.
    • control areas allow aircrafts to collide with each other without being destroyed and they can continue on their way.
    • control towers don’t move and have control areas on the map.
    • control towers appear on the simulation panel at launch.
